# Const-Accel-MC
A quick python script for a constant-acceleration DC Motor Controller, used in MIT's Applied Mathematics Lab. It uses a Phidget DC Motor Controller board to drive a brushed DC gearmotor. This script constantly commands the motor controller to repeatedly change velocity in order to induce ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic states in a lattice of suspended silicone droplets on a wave table.
